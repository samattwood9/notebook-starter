# Notebook starter

## Getting started

1. Use the template to create a new repository.
2. Open in VS Code (at this time it must be VS Code Insiders).
3. Install the recommended exentsions when prompted.
4. Open a terminal and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Create `.py` files as needed (right click the files and select `Open as a Jupyter Notebook` to open in a notebook format).

## Troubleshooting

This template is affected by the following issue: https://github.com/notebookPowerTools/vscode-jupytext/issues/9. The issue means that the same `.py` file cannot be opened as a notebook twice in succession. The issue can be worked around by alternating between two `.py` files.
